-> Qdrant java client is not available in public maven/gradle repo
-> So we have to do the followin for fetching qdrant java client dependency
  1. clone the repo git clone https://github.com/qdrant/java-client.git
  2. cd java-client 
  3. install the library locally
	-> gradlew.bat clean build publishToMavenLocal -x signMavenJavaPublication. It is okay if test cases fails for Docker if Docker is not installed on machine
	-> check if qdrant is installed or not by command 
		"dir %USERPROFILE%\.m2\repository\io\qdrant\client\"
		If installed correctly, you'll see a version directory like: 1.13.0
		check inside dir %USERPROFILE%\.m2\repository\io\qdrant\client\1.13.0\
		expected files client-1.13.0.jar, client-1.13.0.pom. If these files exist, the installation is successful.
  4. Now that qdrant dependency is installed locally.
     -> Go to projects build.gradle and add mavenLocal() in the repositories
	 -> then add implementation("io.qdrant:client:1.11.0") in the dependencies of build.gradle
