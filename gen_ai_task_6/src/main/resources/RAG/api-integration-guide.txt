Our REST API allows users to perform CRUD operations on resources like users, orders, and products.

Authentication is handled via API keys passed in headers. Requests without valid keys are rejected.

Rate limiting is enforced at 100 requests per minute per user. Exceeding this limit results in a temporary ban.

Webhooks are available for key events like order creation or user registration. Clients must register URLs for callback delivery.
